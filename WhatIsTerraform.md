## What is Terraform?

Terraform is a tool for managing infrastructure as code (IaC: Infrastructure as Code).  
By using Terraform, you can define and automate the deployment, updates, and versioning of infrastructure as code.  
Additionally, it offers the advantage of managing resources consistently across various cloud service providers (such as AWS, Azure, Google Cloud, etc.).

Terraform enables infrastructure to be codified, making it reproducible, version-controlled, and facilitating efficient collaboration. Furthermore, software development processes, such as code reviews, can be applied to infrastructure management as well.
